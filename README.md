~~# Working on another version.
### I am working on another extra enhanced version of this using React and Bootstrap. I just wanted to provide a version that is straightforward like this one to meet the deadline and then use some frameworks to enhance it.~~ 

## UPDATE:
### The React version has been finished. You can find it at this repo:

### Thank you so much for this opportunity!
